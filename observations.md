# Kahoot Web App Observations
- on game load there are two intial redirects: one for game pin another for the name 
- Then there is a waiting area until Game Master (Kahoot owner) starts game
- there are then other redirects until we hit the 'gameblock'
- so far we are only dealing with quiz types where there is a max of 4 posssible answers 
- each of these are 0 indexed button types in the html
